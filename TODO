HPGL/2 interpereter:

 - Handling of PP command.
 - Allow the user to load a predefined color/linewidth palette
   instead of using the palette from the HPGL file.
 - Implement raster fill, screened vectors and generate extensive
     test cases for all these ROP-related features.

PCL interpreter:

 - Handle ESC*g12W image setup. (Where's the doc for this on http://www.hp.com ?)
 - Handle raster Y offset in the middle of a picture.
 - Implement more PCL commands, even beyond image extraction. 
 - Add a testsuite, which covers all PCL image compression modes.
 - Merge PCL and HPGL/2 palettes.

EPS device:
 - Implement a better image data encoding like base64 or the like.

Paint device:

 - Optimize small bezier dash segments to lines.
 - Add support for possibly splitting cut/emit into 2 seperate threads.
 - Optimize image drawing for rotations of 0/90/180/270 degrees.
 - Optimize image drawing for images, that are scaled up. (device res. > image res.)

Cairo plugin:

 - Implement pseudo-devices for other cairo backends than png.
 - Discuss with the cairo developers about extending their display model
   in order to allow the representation of PCL and-type ROPs.
 - Activate cairo under Win32.

Images:

 - Handle more than 256 requested colors for indexed images.

General improvements/extensions:

 - Revise PCL/PJL/HPGL context switching code.
