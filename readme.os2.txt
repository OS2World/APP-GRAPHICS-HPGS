This is the OS/2 port of hpgs.exe, an HPGL/2 interpreter/renderer.

This program was built using the Build Environment from Paul Smedley, after a little
makefile tweaking.

I didn't try it; I was just searching for something interesting to be ported on OS/2
and found this a simple exercise in tuning makefile for OS/2.

If you find this program useful, please consider donating to Paul Smedley, who's doing
a tremendous effort in helping to have more OS/2 native applications.

Have fun.
