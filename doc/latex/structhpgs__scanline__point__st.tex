\subsection{Detailed Description}
An intersection point of a path with a scanline. 

This structure has a public alias {\tt hpgs\_\-scanline\_\-point} and holds the information of an intersection point of a path with a scanline.

The order of the intersection. An {\tt order} of 1 means an upward intersection, -1 means a downward intersection. Horizontal intersection are stored as two distinct intersection points with the same x coordinate. If antialiasing is used, the order represents a delta of a broken down winding value. A order of 256 means that the scanline is intersected from the bottom to the top of a physical image row between the previous and the actual intersection point. if The order is smaller than 256, the physical row is not touched in its whole extent an a corresponding alpha value less than 1 is generated.
